# Giftr

-----------------

This is an implementation of a Facebook Chat Bot which we did and won 1st place in a Codeworks Hackaton.
The idea is that a Facebook bot would be used to store a gifts list and the personÂ´s friends would be able to consult it, check which gifts to buy and then confirm that would buy that gift, hence the bot would scratch it from the list.

We used Facebook initial boilerplate to create it.
More details soon.
